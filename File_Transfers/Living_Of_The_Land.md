### Living Off The Land Binaries
The term LOLBins (Living off the Land binaries) came from a Twitter discussion on what to call binaries that an attacker can use to perform actions beyond their original purpose. There are currently two websites that aggregate information on Living off the Land binaries:
- LOLBAS Project for Windows Binaries
- GTFOBins for Linux Binaries

Living off the Land binaries can be used to perform functions such as:
- Download
- Upload
- Command Execution
- File Read
- File Write
- Bypasses
