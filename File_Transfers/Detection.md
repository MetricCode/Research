### Detection
We can easily identify various tools and browsers using the logs on a site.
For this, we can confirm the User agent using this site...

```
https://useragentstring.com/index.php
```
After identifying the various common user agents, we can actually blacklist the commonly known malicious ones and whitelist the known ones.

We can find a list of user agent's here
```

```
Whenever transfering a file, you can be noticed by the user-agent.
