## Terms
**Ciphertext** - The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data

**Cipher** - A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.

**Plaintext** - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file

**Encryption** - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.

**Encoding** - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.

**Key** - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.

**Passphrase** - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

**Asymmetric encryption** - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.

**Symmetric encryption** - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt

**Brute force** - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

**Cryptanalysis** - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths

Whenever sensitive user data needs to be stored, it should be encrypted. Standards like [PCI-DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_for_Large_Organizations_v1.pdf) state that the data should be encrypted both at rest (in storage) AND while being transmitted. If you’re handling payment card details, you need to comply with these PCI regulations. Medical data has similar standards. With legislation like GDPR and California’s data protection, data breaches are extremely costly and dangerous to you as either a consumer or a business.

## Types of Encryption
- Symmetric encryption -  uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. E.g DES (Broken) and AES. These algorithms tend to be faster than asymmetric cryptography, and use smaller keys (128 or 256 bit keys are common for AES, DES keys are 56 bits long).
- **Asymmetric encryption** - uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other in the pair to decrypt.(public key and a private key) E.g RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Data encrypted with the private key can be decrypted with the public key, and vice versa. Your private key needs to be kept private, hence the name. Asymmetric encryption tends to be slower and uses larger keys, for example RSA typically uses 2048 to 4096 bit keys.

### RSA 
The key variables that you need to know about for RSA in CTFs are p, q, m, n, e, d, and c.

- p and q are the prime numbers
- n is the product of p and q
- The public key is n and e
- The private key is n and d
- m is the plain message
- c is the ciphertext


### Digital Signatures and Certificates

Digital signatures are a way to prove the authenticity of files, to prove who created or modified them. Using asymmetric cryptography, you produce a signature with your private key and it can be verified using your public key. As only you should have access to your private key, this proves you signed the file. Digital signatures and physical signatures have the same value in the UK, legally.

#### Certificates
Certificates are also a key use of public key cryptography, linked to digital signatures. A common place where they’re used is for HTTPS.

 The web server has a certificate that says it is the real tryhackme.com. The certificates have a chain of trust, starting with a root CA (certificate authority). Root CAs are automatically trusted by your device, OS, or browser from install. Certs below that are trusted because the Root CAs say they trust that organisation. Certificates below that are trusted because the organisation is trusted by the Root CA and so on. There are long chains of trust.

### Diffie Hellman Key Exchange
DH Key Exchange is often used alongside RSA public key cryptography, to prove the identity of the person you’re talking to with digital signing. This prevents someone from attacking the connection with a man-in-the-middle attack by pretending to be Bob.

Alice and Bob both have secrets that they generate, let’s call these A and B. They also have some common material that’s public, let’s call this C.

We need to make some assumptions. Firstly, whenever we combine secrets/material it’s impossible or very very difficult to separate. Secondly, the order that they're combined in doesn’t matter.

Alice and Bob will combine their secrets with the common material, and form AC and BC. They will then send these to each other, and combine that with their secrets to form two identical keys, both ABC. Now they can use this key to communicate.

### PGP, GPG and AES
PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It’s a software that implements encryption for encrypting files, performing digital signing and more.


**GnuPG/ GPG** is an Open Source implementation of PGP from the GNU project. You may need to use GPG to decrypt files in CTFs. With PGP/GPG, private keys can be protected with passphrases in a similar way to SSH private keys. If the key is passphrase protected, you can attempt to crack this passphrase using John The Ripper and gpg2john.

AES, sometimes called Rijndael after its creators, stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. It was a replacement for DES which had short keys and other cryptographic flaws.

AES and DES both operate on blocks of data (a block is a fixed size series of bits).
