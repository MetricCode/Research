## IDOR

- IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference and is a type of access control vulnerability.
- This type of vulnerability can occur when a web server receives user-supplied input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents), too much trust has been placed on the input data, and it is not validated on the server-side to confirm the requested object belongs to the user requesting it.

### How this works...

- Imagine you've just signed up for an online service, and you want to change your profile information. The link you click on goes to http://online-service.thm/profile?user_id=1305, and you can see your information.
- Curiosity gets the better of you, and you try changing the user_id value to 1000 instead (http://online-service.thm/profile?user_id=1000), and to your surprise, you can now see another user's information. You've now discovered an IDOR vulnerability!

### Finding IDOR's

- You can find the id's base64 encoded in the source code.
- Hashed Id's can also be used but can be used in a predictable order.
- Check requests being sent when a page loads or sends a request.
