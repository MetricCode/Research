- Command injection is the abuse of an application's behaviour to execute commands on the operating system, using the same privileges that the application on a device is running with.

### Discovering Command Injection

This vulnerability exists because applications often use functions in programming languages such as PHP, Python and NodeJS to pass data to and to make system calls on the machine’s operating system. For example, taking input from a field and searching for an entry into a file.

After finding the vulnerability, we can use the following shell operators to combine our command with the one being run on the web-server's backend.
- ;
- &
- &&

### Types of Command Injection
- Blind - There is no direct output to from the application to the user.
- Verbose - Direct feedback is displayed directly to the user.

#### How to detect Blind Command Injection

Blind command injection is when command injection occurs; however, there is no output visible, so it is not immediately noticeable. For example, a command is executed, but the web application outputs no message.

- So, for this, we can use some commands such as the __ping/timeout(for windows)__ and __sleep__ commands.
- We can also use redirection via curl and use grep to try and find if there is any output.

### Remediating Command Injection
- we can avoid usage of some php functions such as __exec__, __passthru__ and __system.__
- Input sanitization - you can remove some specific characters.

### Bypassing the Filters that may be put into place.

Applications will employ numerous techniques in filtering and sanitising data that is taken from a  user's input. These filters will restrict you to specific payloads; however, we can abuse the logic behind an application to bypass these filters. For example, an application may strip out quotation marks; we can instead use the hexadecimal value of this to achieve the same result.
