### Types of Databases
#### 1). Relational Databases
- Most common.
- It uses a schema, a template, to dictate the data structure stored in the database.
- However, when processing an integrated database, a concept is required to link one table to another using its key, called a relational database management system (RDBMS).
- They include : __Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL__ and many others.
- The relationship between tables within a database is called a Schema.

#### Non-Relational Databases(NoQSL database)
- They don't use tables, rows, and columns or prime keys, relationships, or schemas.
- Instead, a NoSQL database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored. 
- Are very scalable and flexible. 
- Therefore, when dealing with datasets that are not very well defined and structured, a NoSQL database would be the best choice for storing such data.

There are four common storage models for NoSQL databases:
- Key-Value(Stores data in json/xml and has a key for each pair. Data is stored as its value.{Almost similar to python/php dictionaries})
- Document-Based
- Wide-Column
- Graph

Most common NoSQL database in MongoDB.

### SQL commands
#### 1). Creating a database.
```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
```
__listing Databases__
```
Mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```
__Interact/Select a database__
```
mysql> Use database_name;
```
__Creating tables__

```
CREATE TABLE logins (
    id INT,
    username VARCHAR(100),
    password VARCHAR(100),
    date_of_joining DATETIME
    );
```

__List tables__
```
mysql> SHOW tables;
```
__List table structure__
The DESCRIBE keyword is used to list the table structure with its fields and data types.
```
mysql> DESCRIBE table_name;
```
__Auto Increment data in a field__
 We can set the id column to auto-increment using the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword, which automatically increments the id by one every time a new item is added to the table:
```
Id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
```
The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a particular column is never left empty ‘i.e., required field.’ 

We can also use the UNIQUE constraint to ensures that the inserted item are always unique.
```
Username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
```
If we use it with the username column, we can ensure that no two users will have the same username.
__Default Value__
the DEFAULT keyword is used to specify the default value. For example, within the date_of_joining column, we can set the default value to Now(), which in MySQL returns the current date and time.
```
Date_of_joining DATETIME DEFAULT NOW(),
```
__Primary Key__
Is used to uniquely identify each record in the table, referring to all data of a record within a table for relational databases.
```
PRIMARY KEY (id)
```
__Final Outlook...__
```
CREATE TABLE logins (
    Id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Date_of_joining DATETIME DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

```

__Insert Keyword__
```
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (column1_value, column2_value, column3_value, ...);
```
The syntax above requires the user to fill in values for all the columns present in the table.
```
Mysql> INSERT INTO logins VALUES(1, ‘admin’, ‘p@ssw0rd’, ‘2020-07-02’);
```
__Inserting Multiple data__
```
Mysql> INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES (‘john’, ‘john123!’), (‘tom’, ‘tom123!’);
```
__Select Keyword__
Used to retrieve data from the database tables.
This retrieves everything from the table.
```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
This specifies the specific columsn you want.
```
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

__Removing tables/Databases__
We can use DROP to remove tables and databases from the server.
```
mysql> DROP TABLE logins;
```
The ‘DROP’ statement will permanently and completely delete the table with no confirmation, so it should be used with caution.
__Alter Keyword__
 We can use ALTER to change the name of any table and any of its fields or to delete or add a new column to an existing table.
 
The below example adds a new column Testing to the logins table using ADD:
```
Mysql> ALTER TABLE logins ADD Testing INT;
```

To __rename a column,__ we can use RENAME COLUMN:
```
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN Testing TO wowo;
```
