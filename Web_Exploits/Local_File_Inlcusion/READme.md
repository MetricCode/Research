# Local File Inclusion/lfi
## @Author : M3tr1c_r00t
<li>
  <ul>An lfi is a web vulnerability which allows one to be able to view the servers files or even include other files within the root folder of the web server.
  </ul>
  <ul>An lfi can lead to information disclosure, cross-site scripting(XSS) and even rce(remote code execution).
  </ul>
  <ul>
  An lfi can occur when a server has been poorly configured or no proper sanitization practices are being observed.
  </ul>
  <ul>
  Lfi's usually occur when an application uses a path to a file as input.
  </ul>
  <ul>
  The server treats the input as trusted and is then executed.
  </ul>
  <ul>
  Other lfi's gives attackers the abilities to upload files into the server.
  </ul>
</li>

For example;
```
https://example-site.com/?module=contact.php
```
As an attacker, we can change the module part, as it being used as a path to the contact.php and try to view the internal files...

```
https://example-site.com/?module=/etc/passwd
```
