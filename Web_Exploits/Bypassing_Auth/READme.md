 Some common flaws in authentication mechanisms include:  

- Brute force attacks: If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker is able to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts. 
- Use of weak credentials: web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as ‘password1’ or common passwords, then an attacker is able to easily guess them and access user accounts. They can do this without brute forcing and without multiple attempts.
- Weak Session Cookies: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, an attacker can set their own session cookies and access users’ accounts.

Mitigation for the auth
- To avoid password guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy. 
- To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute force attacks.
- Implement Multi Factor Authentication - If a user has multiple methods of authentication, for example, using username and passwords and receiving a code on their mobile device, then it would be difficult for an attacker to get access to both credentials to get access to their account.

### Username Enumeration...
If a web-application returns an error message telling you that the username is incorrect/doesn't exist, we can fuzz for it  and use a regex filter on fffuf
```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://MACHINE_IP/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
```
### Brute Force...

```
ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://MACHINE_IP/customers/login -fc 200
```

### Logic Flaw

 A logic flaw is when the typical logical path of an application is either bypassed, circumvented or manipulated by a hacker.

__NB__: The PHP `$_REQUEST` variable is an array that contains data received from the query string and POST data. If the same key name is used for both the query string and POST data, the application logic for this variable favours POST data fields rather than the query string, so if we add another parameter to the POST form, we can control where the password reset email gets delivered.

### Cookie Tampering

We can change the contents of a cookie in various ways ;

#### Plain Text
we can change the values of a cookie directly if it is straight in plain text.

#### Hashing

Most common cookie hashes include:
- md5
- sha-256
- sha-512
- sha1

#### Encoding
Some cookies are also encoded in base64, etc.


### Re-regristration of an existing user.
You can try registering as the user with the rights required.
You can add a space before the name or after the name
